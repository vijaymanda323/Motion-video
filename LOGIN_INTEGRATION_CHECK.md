# Login Backend Integration Verification

## ✅ Current Status

The login system **IS integrated with the backend**. Here's the verification:

### 1. Frontend (motionphysio/login.js)
- ✅ Uses `fetch()` to call `${API_BASE_URL}/users/login`
- ✅ Sends email and password in JSON format
- ✅ Handles responses from backend
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in main login file

### 2. Backend (motionphysio/backend/Controller/Controller.js)
- ✅ `loginUser` function receives requests at `/api/users/login`
- ✅ Checks MongoDB for user by email
- ✅ Compares password using bcrypt
- ✅ Returns proper error messages
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging

### 3. Routes (motionphysio/backend/routes/routes.js)
- ✅ Login route registered: `router.post('/users/login', loginUser)`
- ✅ Routes mounted at `/api` in server.js

## 🔍 How to Verify Integration

### Step 1: Check Backend Logs
When you try to login, you should see in the backend console:
```
=== LOGIN REQUEST RECEIVED ===
Request body: {"email":"...","password":"..."}
MongoDB connection state: 1
Normalized email: ...
Password provided (length): ...
User lookup result: ...
```

### Step 2: Check Frontend Logs
In your React Native console, you should see:
```
=== LOGIN ATTEMPT ===
Email: ...
API URL: http://192.168.0.10:5000/api/users/login
Response status: 401 (or 200 if successful)
```

### Step 3: Test the API Directly
```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.10:5000/api/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your-email@example.com","password":"your-password"}'
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see "Invalid email or password":

1. **Check MongoDB Connection**
   - Backend logs should show: `✅ Connected to MongoDB successfully`
   - If not, check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist

2. **Verify User Exists**
   - Check backend logs for: `Total users in database: X`
   - If 0, the user wasn't created during signup

3. **Check Email Normalization**
   - Backend normalizes email to lowercase
   - Make sure you're using the exact email from signup

4. **Verify Password**
   - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
   - Must match exactly what was entered during signup

5. **Check Network Connection**
   - Ensure backend is running: `cd backend && npm start`
   - Verify API URL in config/api.js matches your IP (192.168.0.10)
   - Check both devices are on same WiFi network

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Email is case-insensitive**: All emails are converted to lowercase
- **No hardcoded admin**: The main login.js uses backend API only
- **Password hashing**: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- **Error messages**: Backend returns "Invalid email or password" for security

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Restart Backend Server** (to pick up logging changes):
   ```bash
   cd motionphysio/backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Try Login Again** and check:
   - Backend console logs
   - React Native console logs
   - Network tab in React Native debugger

3. **If Still Failing**:
   - Check if user was created during signup
   - Verify MongoDB connection is active
   - Check backend logs for specific error messages
